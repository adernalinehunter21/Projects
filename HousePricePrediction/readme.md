###
Description: The project consists of 4 folders i.e. server,nginx_files,client and model is where the Machine Learning model has been created using Python,Numpy Library,Sklearn Library and Pandas library is used to perform the Data cleaning,preprocessing and feature extraction.
###
Server file consists of the Flask REST API server which connects the model and the GUI of the website which will be used to interface this application.
###
Client file contains the GUI for the application which will be used to make this prediction.
###
Nginx_file is used to create Nginx server for which this application can be executed.
